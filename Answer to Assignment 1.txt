    - I also typed pip --version to verify that pip, the Python package manager, was installed.

4. *Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)*:
    - I created a new directory for my project and navigated to it in Command Prompt.
    - I ran python -m venv venv to create a virtual environment named "venv".
    - I activated the virtual environment by running .\venv\Scripts\activate.
    - I could deactivate the virtual environment later by running deactivate.

5. *Installed Packages with pip*:
    - With the virtual environment activated, I installed necessary packages by running pip install <package-name>, replacing <package-name> with the name of the package I needed.
